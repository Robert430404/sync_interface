# sync_interface

This is a web facing interface that you can point at a directory on your computer which will then expose the files contained within for edits and viewing. It's primary application will be a frontend for sync software such as: DropBox, Google Drive, Bit Sync, etc...

This will give you a customizable and extensible interface for viewing and editing your files once the project has reached completion. This will also give you an interface you can use for interfaceless sync daemons when you need to also have remote access to those files.
